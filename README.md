## About project
This is an implementation of a smart mirror design concept. There are a lot of use cases for a smart mirror and smart mirrors also come in many shapes and size. Due to hardware limitation (using a small laptop screen with webcam to implement a mirror), I decided to make it a makeup table mirror.

## Features

As a smart mirror, it shall provide more than just letting user see themselves. This mirror provides:
- General functionalities
    + Current time and date which always stays on
    + Current weather condition and tempature which always stays on
    + Upcoming events in calendar
    + Health report (sleep, walk and calories burned) during the previous day
    + As a makeup mirror, it also provide lighting functionality. User can select warm or white light.

- Advanced functionalities
    + Due to privacy concerns, personal data like calendar and health report only appear when the mirror detect user face in fron of the mirror.
